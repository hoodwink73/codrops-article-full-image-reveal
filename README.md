## Things I am Learning

### Grid is a Blueprint

Okay. I do not know anything about grid. This is a new way of learning I am exploring.
Get the idea from how a UI is using a concept instead of looking at the docs of the concept to begin with.
So this may be a very basic thing. But right now, it fascinates me.

The grid is a class which can apply to multiple elements(container).
This is in contrast to my current intution. I had the mindset that the styles of a container only applies to that specific container and no other container element shares it.

But the abstraction makes sense though. The grid is a blueprint. And more than one UI element can avail it. 

**Place this in the grid. And this too.**
